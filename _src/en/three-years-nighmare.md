title: "After three years, the demand is the same: Freedom for Ola Bini!"
---
On April 11th, 2022, three years have passed since Ola Bini was illegally detained by the Ecuadorian state.

Three years full of violations of due process, intrusions into the privacy of Ola and his relatives, harassment by the
justice apparatus, media lynching and other attacks that have irreversably affected the security and human rights
defender.

It is worrying that far form seeing an end to Ola's legal situation, the obstacles that impede his right to a defense
free of political interventions are multiplying.

Therefore, after 3 years, the demand is the same: Freedom for Ola Bini! The persecution against him must stop now!
Justice and reparation!
