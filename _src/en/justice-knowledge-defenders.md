title: Justice for those who use their knowledge to build a better world!
---
The world is experiencing explosive times where knowledge is threatened
more and more by the institutions in power. There have been many cases
worldwide where experts in different areas have been persecuted using
the judicial system in order to meet political objectives, as seen in
the cases of Javier Smaldone in Argentina and the Egyptian software
developer and activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah, among others.

There has also been the case of Ola Bini, Swedish activist, programmer
and security expert who after three years of judicial persecution by the
Ecuadorian state is about to get a verdict regarding his situation, when
his trial concludes on August 30th and 31st of this year. There have
been many abuses against him along the way, so we do not expect anything
more than justice and respect for due process.

Knowledge shouldn't be criminalized, states must desist from the
instrumentalization of justice to serve a political interest!

Justice for those who use their knowledge to build a better world!
